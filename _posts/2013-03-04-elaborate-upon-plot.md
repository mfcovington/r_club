# Standing on the shoulders of giants

Last week, we reproduced plots made by each other. When preparing a manuscript for publication, we typically go through multiple drafts of a figure until it is just right. For this week's meeting, you should go back and read through *all* of the [solutions from last week]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-02-28-peer-produced-plots-solutions %}). Once you have a better understanding of how to build each of the plots, choose one that (A) you didn't originally contribute and (B) wasn't one of the three you re-produced for [last week's homework]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-02-26-peer-produced-plots %}).

Your mission is to take this plot as a starting point and elaborate upon it. Make it your own by changing whatever aspects you'd like and then add any finishing touches that you feel will make it publication-ready. Your plots will be posted on the R Club website as the solutions to this assignment.

Remember that [the online ggplot2 documentation](http://docs.ggplot2.org/) is your friend. Make it work!

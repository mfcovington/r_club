# Comrades in R

**The Coding Collective™** is a weekly gathering for people that want to code, learn to code, help others learn, and/or collaborate on programming. As of Winter 2013, we meet Tuesdays at 4-6pm (in LS 2002). This is by no means a formal gathering and people can come/go whenever. All programming languages and skill levels are welcome.

My personal plan is to work on my own ongoing coding projects and to learn more about languages, concepts, etc. that I don't know well.

I hope that by having a time and a place set aside for focusing on writing code, people will feel more motivated to consistently develop their programming skills and will be able to help each other work through obstacles.


**R Club Bonus:** Know how you need to have your homework completed in order to attend R Club? What better place to play ggplot than with your comrades at The Coding Collective™?!

**Science Bonus:** Programming is more fun than pipetting.

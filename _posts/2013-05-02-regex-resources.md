**Warning:** Remember that the above resources may have been made with a different programming language in mind. Although the large majority of the content will apply for use in R, there are some differences in the syntax for R-style regular expressions. Many of these differences are in the form of the number of backslashes (`\`) required to 'escape' meta-characters. For example, `\s` represents a single whitespace character in most languages, but `\\s` is used in R.

__The assignment for this week is 2E1 - 2E4, 2M3, and 2M4 from chapter 2.__

### Repository

I have created a github repository for each of you to hold your R Club assignments.  It is named

```
Rclub-rethinking_FirstName.LastName
```

 (where your actual name is substituted).  Within that repository is a directory `Assignment_2016_02_11` and within that directory a template file `2016-02-11-assignment.md` for your answers.  Please enter your answers in the `2016-02-11-assignment.md`.

### Markdown
The file is a [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) file.  Markdown is a nice way to format text files and there are many tools for converting markdown text to nice PDFs or html.  Indeed this page (and the whole website) is written in markdown.  We will probably delve more into markdown in a subsequent class but if you want to learn more now, see [this quick tutorial](http://www.markdown-tutorial.com/)

 You can edit the markdown file with any text editor, but if you use [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) then you can preview the formatted text (click on the "preview" button near the top of the editor).  Another nice option is to use a programmer's editor such as [atom](https://atom.io/) or [sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3); with appropriate plugins these will do syntax highlighting for .md files.  Finally, there are many dedicated markdown editors such as [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/) that will display an editor and a formatted text window at the same time.  __Whatever you do, DO NOT use a word processor, such as Word__

### Getting and turning in the assignments

 * Use your web browser to go to [GitHub](http://github.com)
 * Look through your repositories to find your `Rclub-rethinking_FirstName.LastName` Repository
 * Copy the ssh or html link for cloning it
 * Go to whatever git application you are using (SourceTree or the Github app or command line) and clone the Repository
 * Open the `2016-02-11-assignment.md` file in your favorite text editor (see above)
 * Enter your answers
 * Save, commit, and push as appropriate
